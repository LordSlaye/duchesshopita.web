        <h1>ABOUT A PRIVATE HOSPITAL....</h1>
<img src="Duchess-Hospital.webp ">
<ul></ul>
<p1>Last month, the Duchess International Hospital (Duchess), a subsidiary of the Reddington Group
     commissioned its 72-bed multi-specialist healthcare facility, located on the corner of Harold Shodipo 
     Crescent and Joel Ogunnaike Street in Ikeja GRA.
<ul></ul>
    Speaking at the commissioning of the building, the Vice President of Nigeria, Prof. Yemi Osibanjo said
     the multi-specialist facility will create an attractive proposition to reverse the trend in medical
      tourism in the country. Although this is a small addition, as other well built health facilities
       such as Duchess come onto the market, we should start to see more individuals opting for treatment
        within Nigeria.
<ul></ul>    
    The following points provide more information on the facility, its project team, and how this new 
    addition may impact the healthcare sector in Nigeria.
<ul></ul>    
    Duchess is the 3rd largest private hospital in Lagos by Gross Floor Area, but it does not make
    it to the top 5 list by number of beds.</p1>

<h3>MORE ABOUT THEM...</h3>
<p2>It took 4 years to build, which is a similar timeline to Evercare and other recently completed 
    facilities in the state.
<ul></ul>
    Construction of the Duchess facility commenced in 2016, and the project was completed in 2020,
     even though aesthetic works were still ongoing for some time after. It typically takes at least
      2 to 5 years to complete a healthcare project of that size in Nigeria, based on the recent project 
      that we are tracking.
    <ul></ul>
    The 4-year timeline for the Duchess Ikeja project falls within this timeline and is similar to Evercare 
    Hospital in Lekki Phase 1 that was completed in c. 3years. The facility provides external and basement 
    parking and is also serviced with a power generator, freshwater, and sewage treatment plant. 
    <ul></ul>
    Reddington is pressing hard on its vision of making quality and affordable healthcare accessible to every 
    Nigerian.
    <ul></ul>
    So far, the Reddington Group has at least 3 healthcare facilities operating in Lagos State alone.
     Its first facility, which is the Reddington Hospital in Victoria Island, was completed in 2006, not
      long after that, the brand also delivered the Reddington facility in Lekki Phase 1.
    <ul></ul>
    According to the CEO, Adetokunbo Shitta-Bey, the brand's mission is to ensure that every Nigerian has 
    access to quality and affordable healthcare, and the addition of Duchess Ikeja to its portfolio is a 
    testament to their commitment to achieving this mission.</p2>
    <center.>Service to our patient and their family</center.>
    <h4>HOSPITALIZATION</h4>
    <p3>The patient, his needs and well-being are at the center of our attention. 
    This is the philosophy of our hospital facility.
<br></br>
    The human relationship is fundamental, the patient receives the utmost attention, 
    the best care for the best result, adapting it to the initial state of health.
    <br></br>
    All this is linked to the concept of quality and above all to the quality of the service,
     in understanding and meeting the real expectations of patients and their families.</p3>
